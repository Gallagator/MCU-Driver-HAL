## Developerâ€™s Certificate of Origin

Each commit must have at least one `Signed-off-by:` line from the committer to certify that the contribution is made under the terms of the [Developer Certificate of Origin](./DCO.txt).

If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` as part of your git configuration, you can add a signoff to your commit automatically with `git commit -s`. You have to use your real name (i.e., pseudonyms or anonymous contributions cannot be made). This is because the DCO is a legally binding document.

## Pull request guidelines

- Git commit messages should be concise and must contain a proper description of the commit content. We recommend following Chris Beams 7 rules https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules.
- Add a prefix to your commit message to highlight the area of relevance. Write prefixes capitalized (only the first letter in uppercase, the rest in lowercase), followed by a colon, followed by a space, and then finally the commit title.
- Keep a linear git history: no merge commits are allowed, always rebase your branch.
- Preserve the history until the review is completed. Use `git commit --fixup` to add fixes. Once review is completed, run `git rebase --autosquash` to clean the history.
- Every new addition to an already opened pull request should be commented to inform the reviewers on what has changed.
